        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p class="light">In July 2018, I joined Jungdo UIT's business development team. During 5 weeks, I designed a primary minimum viable product of the Vietnam real estate mobile platform app with developers, UI designer, and PM. This experience helped me learn how to prioritize key app features while maintaining great level of user experiences. </p>

    <h2 class="ten xm-top m-bottom centered">Project Overview</h2>
      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Project Brief</h3>
        <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">Design a mobile experience for Vietnamese who want to buy pre-sale apartments. This application is mainly focused on the needs of Vietnamese buyers, but should be applicable to any first time users.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Primary Problem</h3>
        <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">Because of rapid economic growth and urbanization in Vietnam, countless people are moving to the cities and developers are building many apartments to accommodate those housing needs. Often, Vietnamese people want to confidently and punctually secure a good pre-sale apartment, but cannot because current Vietnam real estate apps are confusing and their information is unreliable.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Goal</h3>
        <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">Design a user-friendly MVP mobile app that greatly improves pre-sale apartment buying experiences.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Target User</h3>
        <p class="ten article-font centered xm-bottom">Vietnamese people who are willing or planning to buy pre-sale apartments.</p>

    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">User Research</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">As a first step for the project, I conducted user research to check whether my proposed problem and goals were relevant to the people we are designing for. <br><br>

      Because our main target audience was the Vietnamese people who want to buy pre-sale apartments, I conducted research on three different Vietnamese co-workers who had already bought an apartment or were planning to buy an apartment in near future. Below are the main objectives of interview and key insights inferred from the interview.</p>

    <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Interview Objective</h3>
      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">
      - I want to know key paint points in buying pre-sale apartments in Vietnam <br>
      - I want to know why people buy pre-sale apartments in Vietnam <br>
      - I want to know who buy pre-sale apartments in Vietnam <br>
      - I want to know how people currently buy pre-sale apartments in Vietnam </br>
      - I want to know important criteria for buyingxz pre-sale apartments in Vietnam </p>

    <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Interview Insights</h3>
      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">
      <strong>1. Key Pain Points</strong><br>
      - Interviewees often do a lot of legwork to find out information about pre-sale apartments due to the absence of a comprehensive real estate platform. <br>
      - Additionally, interviewees believe that current Vietnam real estate apps lack reliability, completeness, and coherence. <br><br>

      <strong>2. Why buy pre-sale apartments?</strong><br>
      - Most interviewees mention that Vietnamese people have a cultural belief that owning a house is crucial to family stability. <br>
      - Vietnamese young working classes prefer apartments to houses due to urbanization and individualism. <br><br>

      <strong>3. Who buy pre-sale apartments?</strong><br>
      - Vietnamese people who are recently married buy pre-sale apartments. They often are financially prepared and planning to have babies soon (Avg. 25 - 30 years old). <br><br>

      <strong>4. What are important criteria?</strong><br>
      - All interviewees consider great location, reasonable price, and good developer reputation as top criteria when buying pre-sale apartments. <br>
      - Besides, interviewees would terminate the contract if there are safety and reliability issues with real estate developers. <br><br>

      <strong>5. How buy pre-sale apartments?</strong><br>
      - Vietnamese people primarily get information about pre-sale apartments via TV advertisements, Facebook pages, and real estate developer websites. <br><br></p>

    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Market Research</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">What about current solutions? How other platforms are doing this? I researched three major real estate apps in Vietnam and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses. <br><br></p>

      <img class="ss-bottom" src="images/batdongsan.png" srcset="images/batdongsan.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="Batdongsan image"/>

      <p class="ten article-font centered xm-bottom">
      The primary application for the Vietnamese real estate community, Batdongsan’s biggest downfall is <strong>information overload.</strong> The application is filled with too much text that do not make immediate sense to the user. As shown in the rightmost image, users need to thoroughly read everything to find their desired information. Additionally, <strong>irregular spacing and monotonous colors</strong> prevent seamless user experiences. However, Batdongsan has the most detailed filtering options that allow curated apartment searches. </p>

      <img class="ss-bottom" src="images/rentexpress.png" srcset="images/rentexpress.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="Rentexpress image"/>

      <p class="ten article-font centered xm-bottom">
      Released in 2017, Rent express has the <strong>most simple user interface</strong> compared to other real estate apps in Vietnam. The application uses <strong>large blocks and photos</strong> to increase scan-ability throughout the application. However, users cannot easily skim the details of the property. Perhaps, the app could have used intuitive icons to show the list of utilities and furnitures rather than describing them using texts. </p>

      <img class="ss-bottom" src="images/nhatrotot.png" srcset="images/nhatrotot.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="Nhatrotot image"/>

      <p class="ten article-font centered xm-bottom">
      Being the oldest real estate app in Vietnam, Nhà Trọ Tốt clearly failed to follow the modern trend of the user interface design. The application uses <strong>confusing text overlays and overly contrasting colors</strong> that reduce readability. While a reasonable amount of color contrast increases readability, too much contrast often diminishes readability. However, it was great to notice that Nhà Trọ Tốt placed search bar on the bottom of the page considering mobile reachability of human thumb. </p>

  <div id="four"><div>
  <div class="case_body">
    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">User Persona</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">
      To better understand our target audience, I created a fictional persona <strong>Jane</strong> so that I develop empathy with a group of real users. Throughout my whole design process, I always referred back to Jane so that I design for real users not for ourselves. <br><br></p>

      <img class="ss-bottom" src="images/persona.jpg" srcset="images/persona.jpg 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="Persona image"/>

      <p class="ten italicized-font centered ss-bottom">
      I originally created three different personas, each with different financial status, but decided to stick with a single persona since all of groups shared similar goals, needs, and frustrations. <p>
