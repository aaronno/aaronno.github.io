    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Prompt</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom quote-border"><em>A new school year is approaching and the orientation team is looking to you for some design expertise. Design an experience for new students to browse, search, and propose new student organizations. Provide your overall process, a wireframe flow, and one to two screens at higher fidelity.</em></p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">I’m going to explain the process I followed to complete the design exercise. More importantly, I will highlight the reasons and the thought process behind my design decisions. I believe that design is about prioritizing and making compromises to solve the most important problem at the moment.</p>


    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Initial Research</h2>
      <div class="flex tab-wrap">
        <div class="eight s-right tab-width xs-bottom"><img src="images/brainstorm_1.jpg" srcset="images/brainstorm_1.jpg 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="brainstorm_1_aaron"></div>

      </div>
      <h4 class="s-bottom text-center">Initial brainstorming to understand the prompt</h4>

      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom"> I began with some brainstorming to understand the prompt of the design exercise and organize my initial thoughts. I took notes of my experience of exploring and joining student clubs in my freshman year. By doing this, I could find out issues with current experiences. At this stage, I just roughly listed out problems with club exploring and joining experience, what features the app would need, and what information would be shown.</p>


    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Understanding the Problem</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">Before we start designing anything we should understand the real problem and find the root cause of a problem.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">User Interview</h3>
        <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">I conducted <strong>six in-depth user interviews</strong> with Cornell students of different grades (4 freshmen, 1 sophomore, 1 senior) to have a better understanding of their experiences and mental models in exploring, joining, and proposing student organizations. This step provided valuable insights into student club joining experiences. <br><br>

        <em>A full list of interview transcripts can be found <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Google-Design-Exercise-User-Research--Am0O5m5fK23jhcmCpbNvztIDAQ-BnsLBDPNRIpWyPYsr65YW" target="_blank" class="link original-blue">here</a></em></p>

        </div>
        <h4 class="text-center">Interview objective / protocol / questions I asked</h4>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Interview Insights</h3>
        <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">We want to <strong>make it easier for new students to browse, search, and propose new student organizations.</strong> The underlying problem is that all club information is scattered around and there is no centralized database or system of clubs. This is problematic because students spend an unnecessary amount of time exploring and gathering information about clubs. Additionally, students often miss important club events or club application deadlines, failing to join their clubs of interest.<br><br>

        To list most popular responses from interviewees:</p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“I hear about student clubs from <strong>all over the place</strong> — like Club Fair, Facebook Events, Quarter Cards, and Word of Mouth.”</em></p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“I join professional clubs for networking purpose and join recreational clubs for recharging experiences.”</em></p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“Most clubs recruit new members at <strong>the beginning of the semester.</strong>”</em></p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“I want to know <strong>what activities are clubs doing and how satisfied their members are</strong> before I decide to join clubs.”</em></p><br>

        <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">Most interviewees are not satisfied with the current clubs exploring and joining experience; Some prevalent pain points are:</p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“I often <strong>forget club events or application deadlines</strong> while I applying for numerous clubs.”</em></p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“We have <strong>a limited opportunity to continuously explore clubs</strong> throughout the semester.”</em></p>

        <p class="ten xl-left article-font quote-border centered s-bottom"><em>“It is <strong>difficult to find relevant club information</strong> without attending multiple information sessions and meeting club members.”</em></p>


    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Defining the Problem</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">Taking these insights into account, I defined the following mission statement.</p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom"><strong>Spend less time and reduce stress on exploring, joining, and proposing new student organizations.</strong></p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">This can be achieved through these three goals:</p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">1. <strong>Make students easily discover clubs and club events</strong></p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">2. <strong>Provide concise and useful club information</strong></p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">3. <strong>Help students keep track of important club events and deadlines</strong><br><br>

      Now we can start designing since we know what we want to achieve through the UI.</p>


    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Sketches and Wireframes</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered s-bottom">What problems to solve, what features to focus, and what information is needed were clear after the above steps, I jumped right into a brainstorming phase. I quickly draw the user flow, trying to include all relevant features I was thinking about.</p>

      <div class="flex tab-wrap">
        <div class="eight s-right tab-width xs-bottom"><img src="images/sketch_1.jpg" srcset="images/sketch_1.jpg 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="sketch_1"></div>
        <div class="eight tab-width xs-bottom"><img src="images/sketch_2.jpg" srcset="images/sketch_2.jpg 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="sketch_2"/></div>
      </div>

      <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">After mapping out the user flow, I could organize my thoughts and was determined to move on to Sketch, where I can easily move around different screens. Below is the final user flow after multiple iterations in Sketch:</p>

      <img class="s-top ss-bottom center_img" src="images/student_clubs_experience.png" srcset="images/student_clubs_experience.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="student_clubs_experience"/>

      <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">This user flow can be divided into four prioritized features:</p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">1. <strong>Onboarding</strong></p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">2. <strong>Exploring Clubs / Events</strong></p>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">3. <strong>Alerting Events / Application Deadlines</strong>

      <p class="ten article-font centered ss-bottom">4. <strong>Proposing Club</strong><br><br>

      These features are crucial to streamlining new students’ club exploring, joining, and proposing experiences. Now I’m going to talk more in details about the purpose of each feature and intentions behind each design decision.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Onboarding</h3>

      <img class="s-top ss-bottom center_img" src="images/onboarding.png" srcset="images/onboarding.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="onboarding"/>

      <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">Most interviewees were tired of discovering student clubs from all over the place (e.g., Facebook Events, Club Fair, Club Websites, Quarter Cards, etc). How might we help students easily discover clubs and club events? I came up with an idea of recommending the best club to students based on questionnaire responses. Instead of wasting much time while searching and browsing student clubs, this simple onboarding questionnaire can greatly reduce the burden of students.<br><br>

      The onboarding process is simple and straightforward. When students open the app for the first time, they will be instructed to either solve questionnaire to get club recommendations or skip to explore clubs right away. I was thinking of <em>making the questionnaire as short as possible to reduce frictions new users might face</em> when they just downloaded and opened an app.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Exploring Clubs / Events</h3>

      <div class="flex s-top tab-wrap">
        <div class="eight s-right tab-width xs-bottom"><img src="images/exploring_clubs.png" srcset="images/exploring_clubs.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="exploring_clubs"></div>
        <div class="eight tab-width xs-bottom"><img src="images/exploring_events.png" srcset="images/exploring_events.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="exploring_events"/></div>
      </div>

      <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">What is the next step after giving club recommendations to students? They would want to see the list of clubs and want to find out more about clubs and club events. I utilized a simple top-navigation bar with a search bar and two menus: <em>clubs and events.</em> This concise navigation enables users to focus on the core interaction of the app: <em>efficiently searching and browsing student clubs/club events.</em><br><br>

      From the visual design perspective, I intentionally used square cards to list clubs and wide rectangle cards to list club events. Usually, people would want to know about events that are happening soon. Therefore, it is unnecessary to show many events at once, better to show large pictures and more details about imminent events.<br><br>

      Analyzing the difference between club information page and event information page, I made sure to properly layout the order of sections based on priorities. Date, time, and location of an event are crucial if you want to attend an event. However, you would not need to see many pictures about the event as they are not an important factor in deciding whether to attend an event or not. Rather, you would want to know who is hosting events and what an event is about.</p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Alerting Events / Application Deadlines</h3>

      <img class="s-top ss-bottom center_img" src="images/deadlines.png" srcset="images/deadlines.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="deadlines"/>

      <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">While onboarding and exploring features encourage effortless clubs/club events discovery, I wanted to provide a smooth transition from club discovery to club joining experiences. Based on the user research, I found out that many club applications are due in the beginning weeks of the semester and students easily forget events and application deadlines. To capture this need, I decided to add the notification system as the main feature of the app. Instead of manually keeping track of numerous events and deadlines, this app will remember and notify them in advance.<br><br>

      If a student finds an interesting club or event while browsing, one can simply click the follow or interested button to receive notifications. I included a pop-up permission option for people who dislike the notification flood, but I subtly highlighted the YES button (i.e., using darker black color than NO button) to promote users to use this feature. This goes a long way towards achieving goal #3: <em>help students keep track of important club events and deadlines.</em></p>

      <h3 class="ten m-top ss-bottom centered">Proposing Club</h3>

      <img class="s-top ss-bottom center_img" src="images/proposing_club.png" srcset="images/proposing_club.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="proposing_club"/>

      <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">Of the six interviewees, only one participant was interested in creating a new student organization. Therefore, I assumed that starting a new club is not a common experience for many students, thus deciding to hide the feature inside the hamburger menu. Besides, the club registration process was quite complicated for beginners so I chose to include basic guidelines, procedures, policies, and a link to get started with proposing a new club.</p>

    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">High Fidelity</h2>
        <div class="flex s-top tab-wrap">
          <div class="eight s-right tab-width xs-bottom"><img src="images/club_information_page.png" srcset="images/club_information_page.png 2x" style="width:100%;" alt="club_information_page"></div>
          <p class="s-top ten article-font centered s-bottom">This is a high-fidelity screen of the club information page. I wanted to <em>provide concise and useful club information</em> so students can easily choose whether they want to know more about the club or not.<br><br>

          First and foremost, this page displays club photos that show what the club does regularly and what are the main activities. After having a big picture of what the club is doing, students might want to figure out the basic information of the club.<br><br>

          I intentionally put the <em>about</em> section right below the <em>club logo/name/category</em> section so people can have a chance to contact the club, visit the website, understand the club size, and estimate the weekly time commitments. Students can wisely use this information at their advantages without reading everything all at once.<br><br>

          If users become more interested in learning about the club after looking at the <em>photos</em> and <em>about</em> sections, they can read <em>description</em> and <em>member reviews</em> sections to determine whether it is worthwhile to invest time applying to this club or not. <em>Member reviews</em> can play an important role in gauging the current members’ satisfaction levels with the club.<br><br>

          Finally, users can quickly preview the upcoming events of the club and can decide to know more about the events by simply clicking on the <em>event</em> card.</p>
        </div>


    <h2 class="ten xm-top s-bottom centered">Things to Consider Further</h2>
      <p class="ten article-font centered xm-bottom">
      1. Conduct multiple rounds of user testing to keep iterate on my solution.<br>
      2. Incorporate search filters so users can better find clubs of their choices. <br>
      3. Add my calendar or favorite page to help schedule management.<br></p>
